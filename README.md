# Azure Kubernetes Service Issues (AKS)

## Overview

This repo is primarily intended for tracking issues with the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It is monitored by the AKS product team, but support is provided on a best-effort basis. For direct customer support, please take a look at the [Azure Support options](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/). Note that the following channels are also monitored and should be used as suggested:

- Feature requests: [AKS Feedback Forum](https://aka.ms/aks/feedback)
- Questions: [azure-kubernetes tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-kubernetes)
- Issues with the OSS ACS-Engine project: [ACS-Engine repo](https://github.com/azure/acs-engine)
- Updates about the service, including new features and new Azure regions: [AKS feed in Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=kubernetes-service)
- Azure Community On Kubernetes Slack: [Sig-Azure Channel](http://slack.k8s.io)

In addition, this repo contains a list of [preview features and related OSS projects](previews.md) that are not yet part of the GA service and thus not covered in the core AKS documentation on docs.microsoft.com.
